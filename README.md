# accessibility-refactoring

## Description

This project featured refactoring a codebase for accessibility standards and search engine optimization for mock client, Horiseon. Here is a [link to the deployed page](https://ajolsavsky.github.io/accessibility-refactoring/).

- The existing codebase did not meet accessibility standards, leaning heavily on div, class, and id selectors instead of semantic HTML and a semantic stylesheet
- Updated this codebase to includes semantic and accessible HTML (including alt attibutions) and organized CSS elements, while retaining original visual design
- Intentionally does not feature responsive design elements (other than the nav bar)

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Usage

Here is an example of the final page.
